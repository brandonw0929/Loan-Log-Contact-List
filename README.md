Description: Allows users to log in to peronsal view of their own loan log. User will be able to log loans & tasks associatied with loans (documents needed, log estimated rate, things the file will need to undergo once application has been taken). Tasks will be logged similar to the to-do list from course. Will utilize a Bloomberg API to run stock market toolbar at the top of the page (for rate estimate, if it's advisable to purchase now, etc. allows for user to log a more accurate rate). Application will also utlilze a zillow API to pull property information in a search bar format (will allow user to get a more accurate property value estimate and reference similar properties), results will display in a seperate frame on the side of the page for user-friendly referencing.
